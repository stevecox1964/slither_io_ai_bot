Experimenting with a slither.io bot

I have weaved together two youtube examples from ClarityCoder and The real GM that allow me to play a random slither.io
game over and over. The AI is really not AI/ML at this point, but I am working on bringing that together.

# Getting started
The main python file to load is test_slitherio.py. You will most likely have to "tune" the window sizes to get the initial
code to work.

This code was ported to Windows 10, and you will need to obvisouly pip install and download several packages which
I will go over later in a youtube video
